While when extracting files to filesystem, the Attributes of the file in filesystem will not be changed (whatever is the overwriting action taken for its data, unless the file is removed using the 'R' policy, which would remove the inode and thus also any Attributes it had).o means 'Overwrite', same as 'O' (but lowercase letter) overwrite the whole EA set and FSA.
Modify the -A option behavior, making it receiving a <date> as argument in place of the [<
Instead of the usual merging where each files of both archives are added to the resulting archive with eventually a tie using the overwriting policy (see -/ option), here the merging builds an archive which corresponds to the decremental backup done based on two full backups.

This allows options placed after the --default-script option on the command line to affect the behaviour of the linker script, which can be important when the linker command line cannot be directly controlled by the user.  
The default behaviour (of not listing the sections that are removed) can be restored by specifying --no-print-gc-sections on the command line.
By default or if --no-ignore-branch-isa is used a check is made causing the loss of an ISA mode transition to produce an error.
Any directories specified by -rpath-link options.
In this case the root of symbols kept must be explicitly specified either by an --entry or --undefined option or by a W`ENTRY' command in the linker script.
The GNU linker uses other mechanisms for this purpose: the -b, --format, --oformat options, the W`TARGET' command in linker scripts, and the W`GNUTARGET' environment variable.

This option specifies that the probe packets must be fragmented.
The default preprocessor argument is W`gcc -E
This is the default option: you will probably only need to specify it explicitly if you have changed the default using the ScrollBar resource.

Use remote COMMAND instead of rsh.
You may supply any number of -r and -a options.
Normally, hspell -a only checks the spelling of Hebrew words.
It can also be combined with the -vlservers argument, but does not interact with it.
This argument can be combined with the -servers argument, -file argument, -stdin flag, or any combination of the three, but does not interact with any of them.
Default 0 creates a \\picture environment with bounding box exactly enclosing the picture (but see -x and -y ).  
Only use TeX fonts, even where PostScript-fonts are specified.
With -f\ 5.3 the following number 12345678 corresponds to 12345.678.
See also -F (no font properties).
The syntax is similar to that used by printf.
\ -l\ Title|Short description|Synopsis\ ... could be used instead of english. .
For instance some applications prefer that the outermost of the three loops (stripes, layers, planes) is over all layers so that all data of the lowest resolution layer is transmitted first.

A line with only -- is printed between blocks of changes.
Append a custom headerfield onto the header; but only if a similar field does not exist yet.  
Using --xz can take some time.  
For example:  1 --graphics vnc,password=foobar   
Use --boot=?
Use --serial=?
The most simple invocation is:  1 --filesystem
This option uses the same options as --serial and --parallel for specifying the host/source end of the channel.

If unsure, try running autotrash with both --dry-run and --stat to see the effect.
It's also possible to use cat.
Install the model template specified by -t option into the player.
If a hostname is not specified with the -n option, then the address will be used instead, and the record will be flagged as unresolved.
Print the control file to standard output (or filename if specified, since dpkg 1.17.2), rather than to debian/tmp/DEBIAN/control (or package-build-dir /DEBIAN/control if -P was used).
Use --no-pull to disable all pulling.
This option, when combined with --content, makes all available versions of all files be synced, when preferred content settings allow.
This does not override any other options, since cloud-init metadata is not otherwise tunable.
Unless --user-data is used to override this behaviour, uvt-kvm generates cloud-init userdata with some sensible defaults when a VM is created.
4 --append-line FILE:LINE (see Wcustomize below)

If the --operations option is not given, then we default to trying most sysprep operations (see --list-operations to show which are enabled).  
Pass following options to cdrecord(1).
If -l is used (ionly file names are sought), then the limit is on the number of files; otherwise, the limit is on the number of records.

See documentation for ’-i’ and ’-o’ options.
By giving multiple -a options, you can control to which chains effects, inputs and outputs are assigned to.
There’s also a realtime variant, rtnull, which behaves just like null objects, except all i
To use ’auto’ in the previous example, ecasound -f:16,2,44100 -i resample,auto,foo-o /dev/dsp.
EFFECT SETUP

Any of the options that accept boolean values ('true'/'false') can also accept 'yes'/'no'.  
The same works for POLYGONs vs. MULTIPOLYGONs.
This can be combined with -a, -c and -d.
Allow coredumps if -u is given (only for debugging).
This is equivalent to setting v=63 in the OCAMLRUNPARAM environment variable (see below).
-C,--category=ITEM   post category (can specify more than one) -T,--tag
The generated HTML pages are stored in the current directory, or in the directory specified with the -d option.
The generated LaTeX document is saved in file ocamldoc, or in the file specified with the -o option.
If the given file is a simple one and does not exist in the current directory, then ocamldoc looks for it in the custom generators default directory, and in the directories specified with the -i option.
Include all modules in the dot (1) output, not only modules given on the command line or loaded with the -load option.

A workaround is to use -geometry +5+23 when using fvwm.
Sets the default paper size (now used only for color-correction output produced by the -g option).
If necessary, use pnmcut to remove everything except the text.  
Ignore everything except file and directories matching this expression.
On systems where dpkg supports triggers, -a turns update-yorickdoc into a no-op.
This matches all and files anywhere in the directory tree except those in the legacy directory and its subdirectories.
Also, other command line options may influence the box size (such as -p).  
This option also gets passed to some of the filtering programs.
1 guestfish --ro -d myguest -i   (for active domains, readonly), or specify the block device directly:  1 guestfish --rw
Can be combined with the --unique option to display a dialog at start-up where the instance name can be chosen with all instances that have tabs stored as suggestions.
Example: hhblits_omp -i query-
Apply -fillscreen and -fullscreen options to all images and not just the first.
That is, getting code produced by GNU Fortran to link to code produced by some other compiler using this or any other method can be only a small part of the overall solution---getting the code generated by both compilers to agree on issues other than naming can require significant effort, and, unlike naming disagreements, linkers normally cannot detect disagreements in these other areas.  
The kind of real constants like W`1will not be changed by -fdefault-real-8 though, so also -fdefault-double-8 does not affect it.
The following combinations are expanded W`\a', W`\b', W`\f', W`\n',

You may use multibyte filters like: 0xFFF0FEFF
Normally you would not need to use the deny-list.
If the deny-list  ( -y ) is enabled and you specify -M twice, the message's addresses are removed from the deny-list instead.

By default, synchronization does not occur when the zoom window is opened, unless option -zoomsync has been set.
Use this only if your server requires a password.
Under MSDOS, -d is case sensitive when it matches names in the zip archive.
But see the new option -ic to ignore case in the archive.0 -db
When using -ws, use
Also possible:  zip -r foo foo -x@excludelst  which will include the contents of foo in foozip while excluding all the files that match the patterns in the file excludelst.
and does the same thing as the short option form.
Neither option will recover archives that have been incorrectly transferred in ascii mode instead of binary.
If -c is used also, you are prompted for comments only for those files that do not have
If no input files appear on the command line and --out is used, copy mode is assumed:  zip inarchive --out outarchive  
All commands take the selector of the style to be defined.

Print condensed output in grep -n like manner FILE:
If an error log is specified with --error-log, all messages will be sent there instead of syslog.
This includes things like InsertionQV and DeletionTag.
Bind to address, Supply as many addresses (using multiple --local statements) to listen on as required.
(Beware, this option is not usually what you want).
The global setting of auto-repeat can be set with xset(1).
Meaning of other optional parameters: -r | --report - request for delivery report -8 | --8bit - set 8bit coding -C

It is a very good idea to first try a run using the --dry-run option (-n) to see what files are going to be deleted.
See also --copy-dirlinks for an analogous option for the sending side.
This overrides the socket options setting in the rsyncdfile and has the same syntax.
For instance, if rsync 2.6.4 is being used with the --write-batch option, but rsync 2.6.3 is what will be used to run the --read-batch option, you should use --protocol=28 when creating the batch file to force the older protocol version to be used in the batch file (assuming you can’t upgrade the rsync on the reading system).
--max-size=1.5mb-1 is 1499999 bytes, and --max-size=2g+1 is 2147483649 bytes.
don’t have that option.  
the --partial-dir should not be writable by other users or it is a security risk.  
Not all options may be prefixed with a no-: only options that are implied by other options (e--no-D, --no-perms) or have different defaults in various circumstances (e--no-whole-file, --no-blocking-io, --no-dirs).  
Using the --partial option tells rsync to keep the partial file which should make a subsequent transfer of the rest of the file much faster.
The default setting of this option is site-specific, and can also be affected via the RSYNC_ICONV environment variable.
Older rsync versions erroneously preserved the three special permission bits for newly-created files when --perms was off, while overriding the destination’s setgid bit setting on a newly-created directory.

However, increasing the weight of a parameter (using the -F, -G, -R, -S or -X options) will make  the associated parameter have a greater effect on the fitness.
LSB (iX86) Product:    
The program defaults to parsing all of the standard RFC2616 method strings if this option is not set.
Combine this with --skip-version if you periodically update files.
Exact behaviour of the commands affected by this option is described below.
When using apt-get source, pass --tar-only to it.
: Saturation: preservation of saturation at the expense of hue and lightness is preferred, example: charts and graphs.
Appears only for backwards compatibility.  
This option tells ctest to run only the tests whose labels match the given regular expression.
-A if needed.
Use this to add your own include directories to search to the build process.
Neither option affects the behavior on non-MIME input files.
The analysis method of LMND (Levenberg-Marquardt minimization using numerical derivatives, see -U, --lmnd) requires the differences that are used during the computations of the partial derivatives of the model function(s).
In the definition expression one should use only the fit/regression variables (as defined by the -v, --variables command line argument).
Do not add C extension code (overrides --ext specified in the global config)\. .

When used with --group-map=FILE, affects only those files whose owner group is not listed in FILE.
Instruct subsequent -T options to read null-terminated names verbatim (disables special handling of names that start with a dash).

It accepts an option specifying which files/devices to use in the following format : [execfile][,[corefile][,swapfile]] (see kvm_open(3) for details on those fields).
Aggregation configuration: Require that an input field may only be aggregated with other fields if they all have the given CF property (standard or non-standard), but not requiring the values to be the same.
--exist=
For example, to insist that a group of aggregated input fields must all have the same CF properties (other than those accounted for in the structural signature), regardless of their values, but also insisting that the long_name properties have equal values, you can use B --exist_all --equal=
This is the default behaviour in the absence of all the B --exist --equal
P options and supersedes the behaviour for the given property that may be implied if any of these options are set.
Be `initial' Aleph for dumping formats; this is implicitly true if the program is called as inialeph . 
This option is very useful and flexible.  
Currently, --body-file is not for transmitting files as a whole.
/etc/passwd and asking W`root' to run Wget with -N or -r
Without this option, Wget will ignore all the FTP links.
Use --no-hsts to make Wget act as a non-HSTS-compliant UA.
Send header-line along with the rest of the headers in each HTTP request.  
This example instructs Wget to connect to localhost, but to specify fooin the W`Host' header:  1 wget --header=Host:
When in recursive mode, only HTTPS links are followed.
If --ftps-implicit is passed and no explicit port number specified, the default port for implicit FTPS, 990, will be used, instead of the default port for the normal (explicit)
Using -r together with -l can help, but since Wget does not ordinarily distinguish between external and inlined documents, one is generally left with leaf documents that are missing their requisites.  
If you need to specify more than one wgetrc command, use multiple instances of -e.    
This works in a similar manner to W`-cp' above, except it excludes the directory from the scan itself.
Ignored if there is no compression (see the B --compress P option). . .

Specifying the password as a command line option is not recommended.
This value is ignored and always set to ADMINISTRATOR when combined with -t target address.
The --css option provides a means to append additional style rules to the end of the default stylescss sheet.

--no-recursion Disable recursive anchor search
Warning: When an application does not properly join all threads (or creates an detached thread), a profile file can be still corrupted.  
Some traditional implementations do not recognize W`#elif', so this option suggests avoiding it altogether.
These -m options are supported on the SPU:
;  return total; }   compiling to (x86_64) assembly via -S and emitting the result direct to stdout via -o -  1 gcc -S test-fverbose-asm -Os -o -   gives output similar to this:  5 testc # GNU C11 (GCC) version 7.0.0 20160809 (experimental)
Note also that this option changes the ABI; compiling a program with a different stack offset than the libraries have been compiled with generally does not work.
-mstack-protector-guard-symbol=symbol overrides the offset with a symbol reference to a canary in the TLS block.  
If an explicit version number is provided and -fabi-compat-version is not specified, the version number from this option is used for compatibility aliases.  
For example, to pass -assert definitions, you must write -Xlinker -assert -Xlinker definitions.  
It does not work to write -Xlinker -assert definitions, because this passes the entire string as a single argument, which is not what the linker expects.  
If profiling is active (-pg), generate a
joined   Display options taking an argument that appears after an equal sign in the same continuous piece of text, such as: --help=target.
Instead of describing the displayed options, an indication is given as to whether the option is enabled, disabled or set to a specific value (assuming that the compiler knows this at the point where the --help= option is used).  
This option is required for fully standards-compliant handling of static destructors, but only works if your C library supports W`__cxa_atexit'.
This is the default unless you configured GCC using powerpc-*-eabiaix.
When -fuse-linker-plugin is not enabled, when a file is compiled with -flto, the generated object file is larger than a regular object file because it contains GIMPLE bytecodes and the usual final code (
GCC enables this option by default.  
See -ffloat-store for more detailed description.  
-musermode is the default when the target is W`sh*-*-linux*'.  
This is the warning level of -Wshift-overflow and is enabled by default in C99 and +11 modes (and newer).  
The default is zero for -O0 and -O1, and 100 for -Os, -O2, and -O3. prefetch-latency   Estimate on average number of instructions that are executed before prefetch finishes.  
Do not use W`abshi2' pattern.
If you specify neither -fpcc-struct-return nor -freg-struct-return, GCC defaults to whichever convention is standard for the target.  
For some ARM implementations better performance can be obtained by using this option.
Turn on all options, except raw, slim, verbose and lineno.
Similarly, W`RAMPD' is used together with direct addressing.
These -m options are defined for the IBM RS/6000 and PowerPC:
-mrelax-pic-calls is the default if GCC was configured to use an assembler and a linker that support the W`assembly directive and -mexplicit-relocs is in effect.  
Dump after jump bypassing and control flow optimizations.
Note that -fvisibility does affect + vague linkage entities.
The standard system libraries are used normally, unless -nostdlib or -nodefaultlibs is used.
For example, -std=c90 turns off certain features of GCC that are incompatible with ISO C90, such as the W`asm' and W`typeof' keywords, but not other GNU extensions that do not have a meaning in ISO C90, such as omitting the middle term of a W`?
There isn't an archive version of libdld Thus, when the -static option is specified, special link options are needed to resolve this dependency.  
These -m options are defined for the ARM port:
For the last triplet, the max_size must be W`-1'.
These -m options are defined for the LatticeMico32 architecture:
However, in case of any conflicts, the later options override the earlier options on the command line.  
With -fno-semantic-interposition the compiler assumes that if interposition happens for functions the overwriting function will have precisely the same semantics (and side effects).
This is a more fine-grained version of -fkeep-inline-functions, which applies only to functions that are declared using the W`dllexport' attribute or declspec.
Enable support for -Wl,--as-needed in all ltmainfiles identical to the one of the libtool package.
This is the default behavior if no other mode action is specified (but note that --setup is a mode action, and has different default behavior).
Use VERTEX as the starting vertex (for sbs, bfs, prim, and dijk)
Adds the --tempdir option with argument path when invoking remote instances of rdiff-backup.
disable logcatgories (show list with --showlogcategories)
This option can used to specify the directory search list.
Do not quote the output.  
Command Option --top is similar to the UNIX top command, however it applies only to sandboxes.
This is mostly a shortcut to avoid specifying the argument twice: zzuf -c cat filetxt has the same effect as zzuf -I '^file\\cat
A summary of all the possible options.
Explicitly force IPv4 or IPv6 tracerouting.
This flag can be combined with any combination of the -prefix, -server, -partition, and -xprefix options.
The specified exchange should already exist unless the --exchange-type                         option is used to request the creation of an exchange.
Treat the value of -w option as point instead of pixel.
These flags can be used to invert the sense of the corresponding normal option.
Terse output, just print the number of open deleted files and exit with a code suitable for use by Nagios and similar monitoring tools (see Exit Status).  
One can combine --remote with -c
Set the metadata user to group during --edit.  
You might need this or the -nt option to fixup things in case you transformed the image with some utility which ignores the exif thumbnail.
The option must be repeated when used with multiple files.
In -bgr233 mode, use 8 colors instead of 256.
-use8 Scale Viewer
Use a normalized starting point for optimization.
Only the root of the filename should be specified for this option, for example: ramp for a grey level colormap.
